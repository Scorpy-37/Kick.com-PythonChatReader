v1.9
- fixed new messages crashing script
- removed login/message sending (redundant considering all the new api wrappers)
- made browser headless
- made browser launch the chatroom page instead of the stream page
- removed usage of bs4
- added tick() function

v1.9.1
- made browser not headless so you can turn it off after the script is closed (most likely temporary until I find a way to close it automatically)
